<br>

<ins>This repository contains data for the blind cavefish *Astyanax mexicanus* with intact or ablated lateral line, swimming through 0, 2, 3, or 4 obstacles.</ins> More specifically, the data contain: 
- swimming kinematics: body curvature, wave speed, wavelength, tail beat frequency, head amplitude, tail amplitude, swimming speed, Reynolds number, and Strouhal number
- swimming speed and distance while crossing the obstacles 
- time for the fish to cross the obstacles
- number of touching events (snout on net, snout on poles, fins on net, fins on poles) while crossing the obstacles, and number of fish that successfully crossed the obstacle course
